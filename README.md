# Voice-Navigator
Your Consciousness.
It’s a parent’s voice when the parent isn't around.
It’s a walking stick without the stick.

This project aims to build a smart interface that captures pictures of your surroundings from your phone, 
recognises objects lying around and tells you all about them as you move around. 
This gives you a sense of direction and judgement of motion of any person who needs technical assistance in moving about.
